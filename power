Well, one thing you could do is simply disable the power button altogether. Personally, I only use it to turn on my machine, and never use it once the machine is on. If this is an OK solution for you, edit /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn-acpi-support:

sudo nano /etc/acpi/events/powerbtn-acpi-support
That file should look something like this:

event=button[ /]power
action=/etc/acpi/powerbtn-acpi-support.sh
To make the power button do nothing, change it to:

event=button[ /]power
action=
Then restart the acpi daemon with

sudo service acpid restart
